					With more than four million copies sold, Wifey is Judy Blume&#39;s hilarious, moving tale of a woman who trades in her conventional wifely duties for her wildest fantasies-and learns a lot about life along the way. Sandy Pressman is a nice suburban wife whose boredom is getting the best of her. She could be making friends at the club, like her husband keeps encouraging her to do. Or working...

I was in junior high school and loved all of Judy Blume&#39;s books aimed at kids my age. This was her first book for adults and when my mother finished it, I gobbled up her copy.

A 1970s suburban housewife&#39;s sexual awakening while her kids are away at summer camp.Everyone in my office is talking about 50 Shades of Grey.
