				<h3>More About <span>Anything But Typical</span></h3>
				<p>But really, if you ask me, there is only one kid of plot. One. Stuff happens. That&#39;s it. Nora Raleigh Baskin, Anything But Typical // Why do people want everyone to act just like they do? Talk like they do. Look like they do. Act like they do. And if you don&#39;t If you don&#39;t, people make the assumption that you do not FEEL what they feel. And then they make the assumption That you must not feel anything at all. Nora Raleigh Baskin, Anything But Typical // All we are, all we can be, are the stories we tell,&#34; he says, and he is talking as if he is talking only to me. &#34;Long after we are gone, our words will be all that is left, and who is to say what really happened or even what reality is? Our stories, our fiction, our words will be as close to truth as can be. And no one can take that away from you. Nora Raleigh Baskin, Anything But Typical //</p>
				<p>Jason Blake is a twelve-year-old boy with autism. This story takes place in the present, but he also goes back to show us the struggles that he has endured growing up. He knows that he is &#34;different&#34; but seems to accept this. The one place where he is comfortable is online, on a site called &#34;Storyboard&#34;. There he posts stories that... Oh my god! I love this book!! Such a good book to end my 2016!I love how Jason used writing as his coping mechanism.I loveeeee the ending.  This is a great children&#39;s/middle grade book and I&#39;d def recommend it to young readers. Anything but Typical is narrated by Jason who was diagnosed with ASD but goes to a mainstream school, we here about his school life, difficulty with teachers and peers, as well as what&#39;s going through his mind in a multitude of different situations....</p>
